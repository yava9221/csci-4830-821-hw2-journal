## Timeline

*   Started: 2016-02-26
*   Merged: 2016-02-29

I have been working with Rethinkdb in the past. I reference their fantastic documentation regularly. I wanted to provide an example of getting the arithmetic mode from an array of data. Rethinkdb requires contributors to sign a [contributors license agreement](http://rethinkdb.com/community/cla/). After signing up I set out to add my example. Examples to the documentation are written in markdown. Changes to the rethinkdb examples documentation must be made for each language Rethinkdb supports: python, ruby, javascript and java. Java was recently added, and in the process of contributing to it, I found a formatting issue with their markdown. My PR addressed that as well.

## The Change

I added an example of how to take the arithmetic mean from an array of Rethinkdb data to the ungroup pages in the documentation for Rethinkdb.
